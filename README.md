Typing on the keyboard for an extended period of time may lead to injuries,
which is why it is highly recommended to take frequent breaks from the
keyboard - and from the computer as well. But sometimes - more often than one
would wish to admit - we tend to forget about this, and plow through, at the
cost of hand's health.

No more.

With the `TypingBreaks` plugin, we can instruct the keyboard to lock itself up
after some time, or after a number of key presses. It will stay locked for a few
minutes (or whatever amount we told it to), forcing us to take a break.

## Using the plugin

The plugin comes with reasonable defaults (see below), and can be used out of
the box, without any further configuration:

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-TypingBreaks.h>

void setup (void) {
  Kaleidoscope.setup ();
  USE_PLUGINS (&TypingBreaks);
}
```

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides a single object, `TypingBreaks`, with the following
properties. All times are in milliseconds.

### `.idleTimeLimit`

> The amount of time that can pass between two pressed keys, before the plugin
> considers it a new session, and starts all timers and counters over.
>
> Defaults to 10000 (10 seconds).

### `.lockTimeOut`

> The length of the session, after which the keyboard will be locked.
>
> Defaults to 2700000 (45 minutes).

### `.lockLength`

> The length until the keyboard lock is held. Any key pressed while the lock is
> active, will be discarded.
>
> Defaults to 300000 (15 minutes).

### `.leftHandMaxKeys`

> It is possible to lock the keyboard after a number of keys pressed, too. If
> this happens sooner than the timeout, the keyboard will still be locked.
>
> This property controls how many keys can be pressed on the left side.
>
> Defaults to 0 (off).

### `.rightHandMaxKeys`

> It is possible to lock the keyboard after a number of keys pressed, too. If
> this happens sooner than the timeout, the keyboard will still be locked.
>
> This property controls how many keys can be pressed on the right side.
>
> Defaults to 0 (off).
