Turn the `Esc` key into a special key, that can cancel any active `OneShot`
effect - or act as the normal `Esc` key if none are active. For those times when
one accidentally presses a one-shot key, or change their minds.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header, and activate it. No further
configuration is necessary.

```c++
#include <Akela-OneShot.h>
#include <Akela-Escape-OneShot.h>

void setup () {
  Keyboardio.setup (KEYMAP_SIZE);

  Keyboardio.use (&OneShot, &EscapeOneShot, NULL);
}
```

The plugin only makes sense when using one-shot keys.

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `EscapeOneShot` object, which has no public methods.
