Support performing custom actions whenever the host suspends, resumes, or is
sleeping. By default, the LEDs will be turned off on suspend, and the previous
LED mode restored on resume.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header, and activate it. No further
configuration is necessary, unless one wants to perform custom actions.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-MyOldFriend.h>

void setup () {
  Kaleidoscope.setup ();

  Kaleidoscope.use(&MyOldFriend);
}
```

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `MyOldFriend` object, which has the following methods:

### `.toggleLEDs(event)`

> Turns LEDs off on suspend, restores the previous LED mode on resume. This is
> called by `myOldFriendEventHandler()` by default.

## Overrideable methods

### `myOldFriendEventHandler(event)`

> The `myOldFriendEventHandler` method is the brain of the plugin: this function
> tells it what action to perform in response to the various events.
>
> Currently supported events are: `kaleidoscope::MyOldFriend::Suspend` is fired
> once when the host suspends; `kaleidoscope::MyOldFriend::Sleep` is fired every
> cycle while the host is suspended; `kaleidoscope::MyOldFriend::Resume` is
> fired once when the host wakes up.
>
> The default implementation calls `MyOldFriend.toggleLEDs`. When overriding the
> function, the default is lost.
