    /* These two lines here are the result of many hours spent chasing ghosts.
     * These are great lines, and we love them dearly, for they make a set of
     * pins that would otherwise be reserved for JTAG accessible from the
     * firmware.
     *
     * Most AVR chips that get put into keyboards have the JTAG port disabled in
     * fuses, but some do not. When they're used for JTAG, then no matter what
     * we do in the firmware, they will not be affected. So in case JTAG is not
     * disabled in fuses, we want to do that in the firmware. Luckily for us,
     * that's doable, we just have to write the JTD bit into MCUCR twice within
     * four cycles. These two lines do just that.
     *
     * For more information, see the ATMega16U4/ATMega32U4 datasheet, the
     * following sections:
     *  - 2.2.7 (PIN Descriptions; PIN F)
     *  - 7.8.7 (On-chip Debug System)
     *  - 26.5.1 (MCU Control Register â€“ MCUCR)
